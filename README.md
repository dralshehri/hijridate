## Features

- Accurate and tested date conversion.

- Intuitive, clean, and easy-to-use interface.
- Most of the methods and formats are similar to those of standard library.
- Multilingual representation of weekday names, months, and calendar notations.
- Easily extendable to support other natural languages.
- Rich comparison between dates.
- Validation of input dates.
- Works on Python 3.6+ with zero dependencies.

## Limitations

- The date range supported by converter is limited to the period from the beginning
  of 1343 AH (1 August 1924 CE) to the end of 1500 AH (16 November 2077 CE).
- The conversion is not intended for religious purposes where sighting of the lunar
  crescent at the beginning of Hijri month is still preferred.
