# Background

The Umm al-Qura calendar is the lunar Hijri calendar officially adopted by
Saudi Arabia for administrative purposes. It was originated from Umm al-Qura
newspaper, the official newspaper of government of Saudi Arabia. The newspaper
is published weekly and its first issue was on Friday, 15 Jumada al-Ula 1343 AH
(12 December 1924 CE). However, the calendar has been printed and distributed
separately by the Saudi government since 1346 AH (1927 CE).

The calendar is widely used in Saudi Arabia, especially by the public
sector. Official documents, political letters, health care records, and
education certificates, are just examples of many other documents that are
dated by the Hijri calendar.

However, the Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in most of the world,
and it has been implemented as the default calendar in nearly every computer
and database.

Therefore, a valid converter between Hijri and Gregorian dates is a necessity,
especially when conducting research, analyzing data, or building applications
that may have Hijri dates. Even though similar packages exist and try to fill
the gap, [Hijri Converter] comes with a pythonic code, more accuracy, and
better performance.
