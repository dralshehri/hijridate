# Background

**hijri-converter** is a Python package to convert accurately between Hijri and
Gregorian dates based on the Umm al-Qura calendar; which is the official Hijri
lunar calendar in Saudi Arabia. The calendar was adopted by the Saudi government
in 1346 AH (1 July 1927 CE) for administrative purposes. King Abdulaziz City for
Science and Technology (KACST) determines the astronomical rules behind the
calendar calculations.

This Hijri calendar is commonly used in Saudi Arabia, notably within the public
sector. Official documents, political letters, healthcare reports, and education
certificates are just examples of many other documents dated in Hijri. In
contrast, the private sector has been using the Gregorian calendar for years, as
the most widely used calendar in the world today.

An accurate converter between Hijri and Gregorian dates is a necessity. For
instance, when conducting researches, analyzing data, or developing solutions
that may have Hijri dates. Therefore, the **hijri-converter** was developed to
fill the gap with higher code quality, more accuracy, and better performance
compared to other tools.
